# MLB Attendance 2022

This is a project created during the Spring 2023 semester for a Python class. It goes over the many factors that contribute to attendance for teams in the MLB. It was created using Jupyter Notebook and has graphs and tables to help visualize the data, as well as text to help describe the data shown. There is no need for installation as the file just needs to be pressed to be able to view the project.
